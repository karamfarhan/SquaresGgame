Ideas to develop in the game:

make more than one mode, where each mode the game will act differently.

Mode1 : the same as the normal mode, but the square's color will not change to the clicker's
color until he keeps clicking until all clicks of the squares go, also, a player can click
multiple times on a square to add more points for him in it.


1320 * 520   Size of the board
40 * 40      Size of one square
1320/40 = 33 horzantil N squares
520/40 = 13  vertical N squares
33*13 = 429  Total N squares
