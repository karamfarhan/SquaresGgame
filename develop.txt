Python 3.10.12

Ideas to develop in the game:

## make more than one mod, where each mod the game will act differently.

Mode1 : the same as the normal mod, but the square's color will not change to the clicker's
color until he keeps clicking until all clicks of the squares go, also, a player can click
multiple times on a square to add more points for him in it.

Mode2 : the same as the normal mod, but when a player occupy a square, other players can't
re-occupy it, and the game will finish when all squares are occupied,so there will be no timer
Or there will be a timer that will end the game when finish, and also game will finish when all
squares occupied

## feautures To Add to develop
I should think of somthing to display while the players are wating in ready countdown
the 10 seconds could be used to display random maps on the square board, where it
color random squares with the colors of the players


the message box's color should be the same as the player color, so players can easily
identify the other players messages



1320 * 520   Size of the board
40 * 40      Size of one square
1320/40 = 33 horzantil N squares
520/40 = 13  vertical N squares
33*13 = 429  Total N squares
