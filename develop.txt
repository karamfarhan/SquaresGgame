Ideas to develop in the game:

make more than one mode, where each mode the game will act differently.

Mode1 : the same as the normal mode, but the square's color will not change to the clicker's
color until he keeps clicking until all clicks of the squares go, also, a player can click
multiple times on a square to add more points for him in it.
