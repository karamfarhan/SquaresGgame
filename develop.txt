Ideas to develop in the game:

make more than one mod, where each mod the game will act differently.

Mode1 : the same as the normal mod, but the square's color will not change to the clicker's
color until he keeps clicking until all clicks of the squares go, also, a player can click
multiple times on a square to add more points for him in it.

Mode2 : the same as the normal mod, but when a player occupy a square, other players can't
re-occupy it, and the game will finish when all squares are occupied,so there will be no timer
Or there will be a timer that will end the game when finish, and also game will finish when all
squares occupied

1320 * 520   Size of the board
40 * 40      Size of one square
1320/40 = 33 horzantil N squares
520/40 = 13  vertical N squares
33*13 = 429  Total N squares
